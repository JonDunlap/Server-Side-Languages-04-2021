# Server-Side-Languages-04-2021
Classwork for Full Sail University's Server-side Languages course. This course explores the different types of server-side languages and then moves into creating a web server using Node.js

During this month's course we explored the similarities and differences of Ruby, Python, and Node.js. The primary project for this month was to create a web server using Node.js and then updating it to use the express package to create the same functionality in an easier manner. The final project for this course integrated our express server with an AWS API endpoint that ran a lambda function to check the input email/password from the webpage against the database to log in a user. 

It was a project that involved the use of Node, express, several packages, as well as utilizing AWS services to complete a fully-featured webpage that has several routes as well as the functionality to log in a user.
