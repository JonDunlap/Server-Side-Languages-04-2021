# Server-Side-Languages-04-2021
Classwork for Full Sail University's Server-side Languages course. This course explores the different types of server-side languages and then moves into creating a web server using Node.js

During this month's course we explored the similarities and differences of Ruby, Python, and Node.js. The primary project for this month was to create a web server using Node.js and then updating it to use
the express package to create the same functionality in an easier manner.
